# TODO - The things I'd like to sort out but takes more than 5 min

 - [x] search in files - ripgrep?
 - [ ] Better spell check - handle camel case etc.
 - [ ] debugging
 - [-] rename reference all files (coc already does this)
 - [-] update imports - file renamed or moved (works *: but buffers with imports need to be open)
 - [ ] coc customize order imports
 - [ ] :term - terminal args
 - [ ] telescope plugin?
 - [x] treesitter - syntax highlighting - coc does this but treesitter is better and works side by side
 - [-] nvim-ts-rainbow (might require treesitter - maybe there's something for coc)
 - [-] ranger (No up to date plugins)
 - [x] nvim/config/plugin -> nvim/plug-conf
