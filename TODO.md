# TODO - The things I'd like to sort out but takes more than 5 min

 - [x] search in files - ripgrep?
 - [x] Better spell check - handle camel case etc.
 - [x] debugging
 - [x] rename reference all files (coc already does this)
 - [x] update imports - file renamed or moved (works *: but buffers with imports need to be open)
 - [ ] coc customize order imports
 - [x] :term - terminal args
 - [ ] telescope plugin?
 - [x] treesitter - syntax highlighting - coc does this but treesitter is better and works side by side
 - [x] nvim-ts-rainbow (might require treesitter - maybe there's something for coc)
 - [-] ranger (No up to date plugins)
 - [x] nvim/config/plugin -> nvim/plug-conf

 - [x] i3 move and resize floating without borders (default: $mod+mouse_drag and $mod+right_mouse_drag)
 - [x] i3 % size floating windows
